<h5>What is the difference between client os and server
os?</h5>

<h6>A server OS basically runs on a given server. A client
OS basically runs on various client devices, such as
computers, laptops, etc. This type of OS is designed in
a way that it operates on any server. This type of OS is
designed in a way that it operates within a desktop.<h6>

<h5>What is the difference between software and
application?</h5>

<h6>The software handles all types of computer tasks,
data, and info. The applications only have particular
tasks assigned to them.</h6>

<h5>How data is stored in computers?</h5>

<h6>Data is stored as files – the computer equivalent of
files stored in a filing cabinet. Files are stored in folders
and folders are stored within drives</h6>

<h5>What is input device, output device, storage device and
processing device?</h5>

<h6>Input devices which are used to interact with, or send
data to the computer (g. mouse, keyboards, etc.) Out‐
put devices which provides result or output to the user
from the computer (g. monitors, printers, etc.) Storage
devices that stores data processed by the computer</h6>

<h5>Which is the fastest CPU?</h5>

<h6>Intel launches the world's fastest desktop CPU - an
unlocked 5.5 GHz Core i9. Intel announced at CES
2022 the 12th gen processor Core i9-12900KS, which
can run at 5.5GHz max frequency. The chip can hit the
speed on up to two cores for the first time, giving the
ultimate performance to hardcore gamers.</h6>

<h5>What is the difference between x8 and x64
architecture?</h5>

<h6>Technically x86 simply refers to a family of processors
and the instruction set they all use. It doesn't
actually say anything specific about data sizes. The
term x86 started out as a 16-bit instruction set for
16-bit processors (the 8086 and 8088 processors),
then was extended to a 32-bit instruction set for
32-bit processors (80386 and 80486), and now has
been extended to a 64-bit instruction set for 64-bit
processors. It used to be written as 80x86 to reflect
the changing value in the middle of the chip model
numbers, but somewhere along the line the 80 in the
front was dropped, leaving just x86.</h6>

<h6>When 64 bit processors compatible with the x86
architecture were introduced, they were referred to as
x86-64. x86-32 (and x86-16) were used for the 32 (and
16) bit versions. This was eventually shortened to x64
for 64 bit and x86 alone refers to a 32 bit processor.
The 32 bit processors are designed to handle a limited
amount of physical memory maximum of 4GB but 64
bit can handle high memory utilizing 8,16 and some
even32 GB.</h6>

<h6>The 64 bit computers can run both 32bit programs
and 64 bit programs. 32 bit computers cannot run 64
bit programs, because the bit sizes are fundamentally
different. Latest Laptops with pre-installed Windows
are usually x64 i.e. 64 Bit, old Desktops and Laptops
could be having Windows x86 which means 32 bit.</h6>

<h5>What is the difference between input and output
device?</h5>

<h4>An input device is connected to a computer that sends
out data into the computer, while an output device
is connected to a computer that receives incoming
data.</h4>

<h1>Networking</h1>

<h5>What is computer networking?</h5>

<h6>Computer networking refers to interconnected
computing devices that can exchange data and share
resources with each other.</h6>

<h5>What are the benefits of computer connected to the
network?</h5>

<h6>File sharing - you can easily share data between
different users, or access it remotely if you keep it on
other connected devices.</h6>
<h6>Resource sharing - using network-connected
peripheral devices like printers, scanners and copiers,
or sharing software between multiple users, saves
money.</h6>

used for the identification and location of a network
device</h6>

<h5>What are is the limitations of cat 5e?</h5>
